# SQL Project for Data Analysis
## Project Overview
This project involves analyzing job postings data to identify various trends and insights related to job skills, salaries, and demand. The data is structured into several CSV files and is processed using SQL scripts. The project aims to provide valuable insights into the job market, including the most demanded skills, top-paying jobs, and optimal skills for specific job titles.

## Project Structure
The project is organized into the following directories and files:

[project_sql folder](/project_sql/): Contains SQL scripts for various analyses.
1. 1_top_paying_jobs.sql 
2. 2_top_paying_job_skills.sql
3. 3_top_demanded_skills.sql
4. 4_top_paying_skills.sql
5. 5_optimal_skills.sql

[sql_load folder](/sql_load/): Contains SQL scripts for loading and setting up the database.
1. 1_create_database.sql
2. 2_create_tables.sql
3. 3_modify_tables.sql

## Tools

*Here's the chart visualizing the demand count and average salary for various skills:*

- The blue bars represent the demand count for each skill.
- The red line represents the average salary associated with each skill.

**This chart helps to understand the relationship between the demand for specific skills and their corresponding average salaries.**

## Conclusion
This project showcases the power of SQL in analyzing job market data to extract valuable insights. By understanding the trends and demands in the job market, individuals can make informed decisions about skill development and career growth.
